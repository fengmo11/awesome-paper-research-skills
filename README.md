# Awesome Paper Research Skills

A curated map of open-source paper-related AI skills and workflows: idea
discovery, literature search, experiment-to-paper bridges, academic writing,
citation verification, LaTeX/DOCX formatting, and peer review.

This repo is built for researchers, students, and AI-agent builders who want to
study the best public `SKILL.md` packs and assemble a serious paper pipeline
without opening fifty tabs.

## Why This Exists

Paper-related AI skills are fragmenting fast. Some repositories are full skill
libraries, some are single `SKILL.md` files, some are research automation
pipelines, and some are citation or formatting utilities. This list organizes
them by workflow stage so you can study, compare, fork, and compose practical
paper skills.

## Top Skill Packs

Star and fork counts are observed signals from GitHub/search snippets at the
time of curation. They move quickly, so treat them as ranking hints rather than
live counters.

## How To Choose

- If you want to learn skill structure, start with AI-Research-SKILLs, academic-research-skills, and Hermes `research-paper-writing`.
- If you want paper-specific skill decomposition, study RE-paper-writing and its claim-evidence, citation, review, and submission gates.
- If you want an end-to-end research loop, study AI-Scientist, AutoResearchClaw, data-to-paper, or InternAgent as pipeline references.
- If you mainly need paper drafting and export, study OpenDraft or Hermes.
- If citation correctness matters most, combine OpenDraft, litdb, AutoCitation, and refchecker.
- If you are building a Codex/Claude/GPT workflow, use paper-search-mcp plus a modular `SKILL.md` writing pack.
- If you want a public demo project, build a narrow workflow first: "PDF to claim-evidence map", "arXiv radar", or "citation verifier".

## Recommended Open Stack

For a practical human-in-the-loop paper pipeline:

1. Idea and feasibility: AI-Scientist or Open Coscientist.
2. Literature search: paper-search-mcp, litdb, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex.
3. Experiment planning: AI-Scientist, AutoResearchClaw, data-to-paper.
4. Drafting: OpenDraft or hermes-agent.
5. Citation verification: AutoCitation, refchecker, CrossRef/OpenAlex checks.
6. Formatting: LaTeX template, Pandoc/DOCX export, venue checklist.
7. Review: ai-peer-review plus a custom scorecard.
